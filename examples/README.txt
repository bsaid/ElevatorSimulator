These examples have been created by students, so they may not use the best practices everywhere. Some examples implement elevators that are not very friendly to the users.

Each example consists of 2 files, one JSON and one Python code with the same name. If an example implements its own modules, they use the example name as their prefix.

If the example does not run (usually due to incorrect path settings), you can copy the files to the root folder of this repository, then they should run without problems.
